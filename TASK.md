## RATE THE TESTS OUT OF 10

User will record a video of one of the task listed above. Then hit and api with the video. Your work is to make that api. Retrive that video from the api. Now using some pre-trained ML model, do analysis on it and generate a rating out of 10 for that specific task user recorded the video for. Use any pre-trained model by google. User language and framework of your choice to make it fast. Keep things bare miminum.
